== Lab 3 - Creating an OpenShift Test Release and A/B Test or Blue/Green Release Deployment

In this lab, we will use an OpenShift Template to replicate the product-catalog application deployment, using the *next-release* imagestream tag.  We will then review the ability of OpenShift Routes to split application network traffic across multiple OpenShift/K8S Services, enabling either A-B Test or Blue/Green Release Deployments.

== Create the product-catalog Test Deployment

In this step, we will use a YAML Template to generate a product-catalog Test deployment in our OpenShift project:

1. From the command line and where this project was cloned, navigate to the */lab/.openshift* directory
2. Ensure you are logged into OpenShift and your Lab Project, then execute the following *oc* command:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc process -f product-catalog-test-tmp.yaml | oc create -f -
----
+
If the command executed successfully, you should see the following output
+
[source,bash]
----
deploymentconfig "product-catalog-test" created
service "product-catalog-test" created
route "product-catalog-test" created
----
3. From the OpenShift Web console, you should now see a new instance of the Product Catalog application deployed as "product-catalog-test".  Use the newly created *Route* to verify the Application, it shares the same Postgres DB as the initial deployment:

== Configure product-catalog-test for an A/B Test Deployment

In this step, we will update the the product catalog app and before releasing it, use the ability of OpenShift Routes to split traffic across multiple OpenShift K8S Services to implement an A/B Test Deployment:

1. Let's start by updating the version number in our Product Catalog List.  Edit the jsp page - /lab/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/productList.jsp and update the version number in the html *page-header* as shown below:
+
[source,xml]
----
<div class="page-header">
   <h1>Admin - Product List v1.01</h1>
</div>
----

When finished with the document commit it back to the GitHub repository

$ git commit -a

$ git commit push

2. Kick-off the *product-catalog-mvn-pipeline* build pipeline, to create and deploy a new container image with our update.  *Do not* execute the Tag and Release step.  At this point, we should now have two versions of our Product Catalog application deployed, represented by the *latest* (new build at version 1.01) and *next-release* (original build at version 1.00).

3. Go ahead and open both versions of the application in two different Browser tabs, using the *product-catalog* and *product-catalog-test* Routes and validate that they each display the different html page header.

4. We will now update the *product-catalog-test* Route to split traffic across *both* the *product-catalog* and *product-catalog-test* Services.  From the Web Console, select *Applications*, *Routes*, then the *product-catalog-test* Route.  Select *Edit* from the *Actions* Drop-Down list and update the Route as shown below:
+

The product-catalog-test application deployment should be updated as shown below:

We know have the ability to conduct A/B Test Scenerios using the *product-catalog-test* Route which will evenly disperse http client sessions across the two application versions we have deployed in our OpenShift project.  See this in action, open a Browser tab in your current session for the *product-catalog-test* Route:

image::https://github.com/ghoelzer-rht/ocp-rhoar-spring/blob/master/lab/images/spring-lab-abtest1.png[]

Now open a new Browser window using a *private session* for the *product-catalog-test* Route again.  It may take a couple of tries of opening new Browser window's with private sessions, depending on where we are at in the Round-Robin routing, but you should be able to view the other version of the Application:

== Demonstrate a Blue/Green Product Catalog Deployment

In this step, we will demonstrate a Blue/Green deployment, using the *product-catalog-test* application deployment within our OpenShift Project, leveraging the ability to split or direct http network traffic across multiple OpenShift/K8S Services:

1. Now that we have created Product Catalog release 1.01, let's make that available to the our Testing team that is testing against our *product-catalog-test* Route, by forcing *all* traffic to use our latest application build.  Select *Applications*, *Routes*, then the *product-catalog-test* Route.  Edit the Route and update/save the configuration as shown below:

+
image::https://github.com/ghoelzer-rht/ocp-rhoar-spring/blob/master/lab/images/spring-lab-bluegreen1.png[]

2. To verify that all Browser sessions point to the latest application build, refresh the page used on both Browser windows we use for our A/B Test.  They should now both display *Admin - Product List v1.01*.

3. Consider the following Scenario, the Testing team found an issue with the new release.  While the Testing team wants to continue verifying their new automated test suite against the current release, the Dev Team wants to fix/unit test the new features.  To keep our Delivery stream moving, let's update the *product-catalog-test* Route to fall-back to the current release.  Go back like we did previously and update/save the *product-catalog-test* so 100% of the traffic goes to the *product-catalog-test* Service.  After you save your changes, your Route Configuration should look like this:

+
image::https://github.com/ghoelzer-rht/ocp-rhoar-spring/blob/master/lab/images/spring-lab-bluegreen2.png[]

Now refresh the page in each Browser session like we did previously, they should both display *Admin - Product List v1.00*.  Now both teams can continue on with their Development and Testing activities without interruption!
